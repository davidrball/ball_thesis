\emph{This work is dedicated to the teachers and mentors I was lucky to have that propelled me towards graduate school at the University of Arizona:  
	to Aaron Noble, my high school physics teacher, who made me realize I wanted to study physics in the first place.  Mr. Noble's classes are, to this day, some of the best and most engaging physics classes I've ever been privileged enough to attend.
	To Prof. Andrea Dobson, who convinced me to take her intro astronomy class during my first semester in college, and whose excellent lecturing, expertise, and community building at Whitman convinced me to major in astronomy as well as physics.
	To Prof. Moira Gresham,  who was an inspirational mentor and incredible teacher of the upper level physics classes I took at Whitman.
	I would also like to thank my parents for their constant support and encouragement to pursue my dreams.  
	Finally, I thank my wife, Laurel, for loving and supporting me (both emotionally and financially) throughout graduate school, for always having my back, and for making me the best version of myself.  And for convincing me that getting a pug was a good idea.  You were right.  Here's to the rest of our lives together.
